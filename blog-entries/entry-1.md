# Ep: 1 What to do?

##### Welcome to the start of my Independent Study!

This is where I will be taking 9 weeks in my software engineering class to learn mostly on my own. This Project has many benefits including having the opportunity to learn how to learn, as well as giving us the freedom to choose whichever topic intrests us. This kind of freedom is not something I would say is needed in class it is just something that hasn't been present. A full class, all possibly learning completely different things is just fascinating. 

##### Choosing a topic(s)

Finding out what topic I wanted to study wasn't too much of a hassle. I figured once I decided on what to study, doesn't mean I won't be able to study the other ones either. I'll just have to do it when I have the time. However currently Firebase and Java has peeked my intrests. 

##### Firebase?

Firebase is basically a real-time datastore where you can store data for free and access them in real time. It is really powerful and can help a small time app a great deal. Beign able to customize your app just like that is amazing. Just thinking about learning can prove to be a great idea because learning how a real-time datastore works with your app can increase the amount of knowledge you know about how you can store data for later use.

##### Java?

Java is basically another language that my SEP didn't cover, however we did bits and pieces. With java I am able to learn a new language, which is tough however I think it is manageable, to create an app that I had thought of during my last project. Using java I could make an app that could be used on androids and not just the web browser like javascript. So i think its inevitable to learn java.

##### Thoughts and Reflection

I could've taken it easy in my last project of my senior year, however I think this is the project that counts the most. Not because it is a project that you have t thoughtfully take care of over the next 9 weeks. Or because you have to finish the SEP with a BAM. I truly think this project is the start of how you use software in your life. This independent study is how you will study or be a small part of your future. Depending on what I want to do can be all but determined right here. So stay tuned!
