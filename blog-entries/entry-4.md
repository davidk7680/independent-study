# Ep: 4 Planning?

##### Where do I start and where do I finish?

Over the past weak, I was trying to find out what I wanted to do exactly. The thing is, it wasn't to create an amazing app or, to learn all of java and firebase. It was to learn how to learn. I lost my train of thought when I was trying to do a bunch of things that I couldn't really do. So I started thinking of what I wanted to do during this project, while learning how to use [codenvy.com](https://codenvy.com/).

##### What's the plan?

See the thing with planning is that you can't just make a goal for yourself and just try sticking with it the entire time. I decided to make a plan based on what I was up to according to where I wanted to finish. Right now I am going to start creating java programs that can be connected with firebase. This will take time so I am aiming for 2 programs within 2 weeks. If I can finish 1 program by the end of this first week then I'll be on track.

##### Reflection

Whenever you are trying to learn some something new it can be overwhelming. Just taking your time and finding out what want to know is a start. There are so many different things in a different language, but also the same.

For example between Ruby and Java:
* Different built-in classes
* Different syntax

* Both object-orientated languages
* Both _require_ or _import_ packages 

Having knowledge of another language is very helpful. So  trying to relate it back to languages you've already learned should be the first step. Some things might seem familiar but could also be very different because you just aren't used to it. 

    int[] a = {1,2,3,4}; boolean contains = IntStream.of(a).anyMatch(x -> x == 4);
    
The code above is a line of code that will check if within the array there is a integer of 4. There are so many parts of the line that can be talked about but I won't go into details.

Also, in Java you have to compile your code before you run it unlike ruby. So you have to do 2 steps to run your program unlike ruby.
