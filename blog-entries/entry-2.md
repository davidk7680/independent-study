# Ep: 2 How to Java

##### Let's learn Java!

Over the past week I have been learning java through the help of tutorials made by others and codecademy. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) is a very beginner friendly site that helps you learn how to code depending on the language you desire. Learning the basics of java like the syntax and how to write certain code was very easy. Although it was very easy to learn it also didn't feel like I was actually learning the meaning behind everything I was typing. For example I was taught that the following code was where the program actually ran, however I didn't know what any of that code actually meant.
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println();
        
    }

*public* means the method can be accessed from anywhere
*static* means the method can be called through just its name and not by creating a new object
*void* is a the return type
*main* is just the name of the method
*String[] args* means that the only types of arguements allowed are strings

All of this was explained simply on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Since I am the type of person wanting to know everything that is going on, so I'm not missing anything, I need to know what everything means if it has a meaning. I also learned what all these words meant in a youtube video where the person in the video was teaching the core of java, however to me it still felt a bit confusing. So I just searched it up.

I'm not trying to say that codecademy doesn't teach a lot or stack overflow is the best thing ever, It's just there are so many different resources to use while learning how to do something. Along the way, I also figured out that somethings are just fine left untouched. In other programming languages there is pre-written code that people just follow some knowing what it does and some not knowing. It's fine to be either, but to me, I want to know everything especially when learning a new language by myself.
